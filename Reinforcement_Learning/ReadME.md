Some Reinforcement Learning projects:
I just started learning the RL algorithm, so did some hands-on with some common problems
Simple Q-table algorithm works fine with OpenAI gym render but the CartPole doesn't although the code works, the model is correct, final reward is 1.0 everytime, but to render it on google colab needs additional packages and libraries, but it seems still I'm not able to do it properly.

Let's play_DOOM is incomplete, will update it later, my Laptop died while running it and Google Colab is unable to render the scenes. I had used VizDoom for this.

Planing to do a Deep_Reinforcement_Learning network with popular Atari games, but needs ROMs till now everything I tried was not supported by OpenAI's retro package.

More plans- Get acquinted with the algorithm more and more and find ways to be used in research related work, animal behaviour, neuroscience stuff.
