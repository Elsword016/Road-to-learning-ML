# Road to learning ML

This repository aims towards my learning path of ML algorithms, it has some beginner to intermediate-level projects. I'll keep on updating the repo, with time. But, till now it contains all my projects over the last year. Some codes are not given with the results, it mainly cause my laptop is not good and almost at its death bed and at times, it would crash even running on google colab.

**YOLO project** = I successfully applied the YOLO algorithm on a dataset of images with guns that were already annotated. I also looked for ways to optimize the network performance on Google Colab.

**Reinforcement Learning** is an exciting and challenging field that I am still exploring. I enjoy creating games and other applications using this technique. One of my current projects is to train an agent to play DOOM, but I encountered some difficulties with the vizdoom libraries and the local training. I also tried Cartpole, which worked well, but I could not render it on Google Colab. I am working on solving these issues.

**Scraps** = These are some of the codes that I started but never finished. I either had difficulties in implementing them, changed my mind to a different idea, or simply lost track of them :(

### Some **resources** I followed:
1. Andrew Ng's course on Coursera
2. IBM's machine learning course
3. Random medium/towardsdatascience blogs
4. Freecodecamp.org videos
5. deeplearning.ai course on Coursera(3 parts)
6. Short courses on kaggle(specially exploratory data analysis)

for **YOLO**, I forked the official darknet github repo and made changes.



#### **Changes**:
1. Added a complete YOLO on custom data in YOLO_object detection.
2. Loaded Synapse EM images, for next project.(private viewing)
3. Fixed a small error in YOLO_custom notebook
4. Added a new file implementing GradCAM, soon will be using it on Covid-Chest Xray dataset
