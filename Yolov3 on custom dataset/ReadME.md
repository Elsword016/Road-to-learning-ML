Using YOLOv3 architecture from darknet and its pre-trained weights and implementing on custom labelled dataset to train the network. The notebook is written to implement it in the Google Colab platform, still quite unstable. 

  1. Yolo_weights= for setting up training parameters and the loading the architecture in Google Colab, in progress
  2. Yolo_prediction = coming soon
