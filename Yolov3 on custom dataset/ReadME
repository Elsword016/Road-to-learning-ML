Using YOLOv3 architecture from darknet and its pre-trained weights and implementing on custom labelled dataset to train the network. The notebook is written to implement it in the Google Colab platform, its crashing my laptop as it takes long time to train and ram utilization goes to 100% but it works nonetheless, a better system will do it perfectly.

**Changes to the directory: 
1. YOLO_custom notebook added containing the entire method to train the architecture on Google Colab without overloading its memory. 
2. Updates the darknet-master coming, once I arrange all the files nicely with all the custom cfg files used here.

*It takes a long time to train the network on nay given dataset, so a symbolic link to your Gdrive will be useful if you're planning to train it on Google Colab as Colab's 
memory gets refreshed every 12 hours session, so all the variables will lost, so the model will be saving weights after every 1000 epochs, and the symbolic link will copy
the weights from the darknet/backup to your designated folder in the drive and next time you can use that weights to start your training.

*Tool used for annotation of the data: VOTT by Microsoft, can use locally as well as on web, but requires Azure connection in web. Other tools can be used- makesense.ai.
*Whatever tool you're using make sure the to save the annotations in YOLO format. 

* I guess this configuration can be used for detecting in video clips, and in real time too.

*Try to deploy it as web app or service.


*Coming up- One more image segmentation(using polygons than rectangles) to a research: Electron Microscope images of Freeze-Fracted synapses and label and different
immunogold stained receptors.
