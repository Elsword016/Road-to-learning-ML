Using YOLOv3 architecture from darknet and its pre-trained weights and implementing on custom labelled dataset to train the network. The notebook is written to implement it in the Google Colab platform, its crashing my laptop as it takes long time to train and ram utilization goes to 100% but it works nonetheless, a better system will do it perfectly.

**Changes to the directory: 
1. YOLO_custom notebook added containing the entire method to train the architecture on Google Colab without overloading its memory. 
2. I used a custom gun images, to train the network
3. It takes a long tim
